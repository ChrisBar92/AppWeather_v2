This is a project weather app. In the app you can check the current weather, temperature, humidity, wind and pressure in a random city. Default city name is "Krakow", because this is my city. Each weather icon is also dynamically downloaded by axios and automatically updated. In addition, there is support for the Polish language so you can enter both the English version of the city and the Polish version. The app is responsive and also works on mobile devices. Below are screenshots of how it looks on desktop and mobile.
